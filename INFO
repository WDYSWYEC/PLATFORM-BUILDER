In the music industry, the way things currently exist, fan/listeners donâ€™t have a direct way of interacting with and supporting their favorite music. 
Music ownership and licensing are complex and middle-manned by multiple parties. Artists need to use multiple platforms and tools to make, share, 
collaborate and distribute their songs. 

PLATFORM and BUILDER seek to solve these problems by enabling artists to collaborate with others via the web and monetize not only
their songs but their instruments, parameters and sessions as well. All while tracking ownership data and giving fans/listeners
a way to directly support their favorite songs and to be rewarded for doing so through distributed ledger use, storage blockchain
interoperability and smart contract staking.
